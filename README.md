```Business Before User Interface
In your level 2 course you will learn how to write coded, automated tests to assist in the BDD process. When these tools are available we will not write user interface logic until all basic back-end logic is present and passes specs.

Because we're testing manually in Intro to Programming, we had to begin with basic HTML and user interface logic to see our results. This is absolutely alright for now, just know that user interface logic should not be written until after business logic is complete in your level 2 course.

User Interface
As mentioned, we simply created the bare minimum user interface to allow us to manually test our application. Now that all necessary business logic is present, and passes all of our tests, let's add more.```
